# VIDA / vidAI

An aquatic artificial life simulator with articulated 2D bodies, physical swimming,
recurrent neural controllers, mouth-specific feeding, inherited mutations and eggs.
Imported from the current VIDA Playground export (`project-files (10).zip`).

**Play:** https://smeagol44.github.io/vidAI/

## Development

Use Node.js 24 LTS (minimum 22.12).

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the printed URL ending in `/vidAI/`. No API keys, Google account, backend,
or Playground SDK are required. Dependencies, CSS, images and audio are bundled
locally into the build. Exported Playground configuration values are retained.

```sh
npm test             # actual gameplay kernel regressions and 60-second ecosystem run
npm run build        # TypeScript checks and production build
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
npm run test:e2e     # production build at the Pages subpath
npm run preview      # serve dist locally after building
```

## GitHub Pages

The repository's Pages source should be **GitHub Actions**. Every push to `main`
runs simulation tests, type checks, a production build and a Chromium smoke test,
then deploys `dist` to Pages. Pull requests run the checks without deployment.
The workflow can also be started manually from the Actions tab.

Vite's base URL is `/vidAI/`; update `vite.config.ts` if renaming the repository
or moving to a custom domain. Images and music use imported asset URLs, so they
resolve correctly below the repository subpath.

## Controls

Choose **Seed Simulation** to start. Drag the tank to pan and scroll to zoom.
Click a creature to inspect it. Space pauses/resumes; the on-screen buttons
provide settings, simulation speed, specimen tools, ecosystem export/import,
and diagnostics. The help panel lists the other shortcuts.

Simulation energy and time use the game's existing calibrated units. Finite
lifespans and natural extinction remain enabled. See [project status](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md)
for verified repairs and remaining limitations. Original asset provenance is
retained in `design/asset_manifest.json` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
