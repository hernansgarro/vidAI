# Project status — 2026-10-19

## Latest export update

Integrated `project-files (11).zip` using the previous export as a merge base.
This retains all new game changes: inherited target clutch size and maturity age,
budget-limited clutches, nutrient-distinct creature colors, new trait displays,
and diagnostics-window closing without clearing the creature selection.

The standalone Pages build, bundled asset URLs, exported configuration defaults,
configured population cap, zero-valued settings, and previously tested energy
accounting repairs are preserved. The hosted Playground SDK is still unused.

Local validation: **12 simulation tests passed** and `npm run build` passed.
The added coverage exercises inherited clutch limits, partial affordable clutches,
inherited maturity, and energy-conserving egg funding through the gameplay kernel.
The existing single-egg regression now uses the explicit one-egg budget instead
of the new desired-clutch budget.

In the same seeded 60-second workload described below, all 18 founders survived,
one offspring hatched, one egg remained, and no deaths occurred. The energy ledger
discrepancy was approximately **1.4 × 10⁻⁸ J**. This remains a short startup check;
long-term ecological sustainability is unverified. Chromium execution and Pages
deployment are checked by the existing GitHub Actions workflow on push.

## Initial GitHub Pages import

## Scope

This is the **2D** VIDA project from `project-files (10).zip`, not the separate 3D
experiment. The attached source and assets are retained alongside a standalone
React/TypeScript/Vite build. Tailwind CSS is compiled locally, and the application
no longer initializes Google's hosted Playground SDK. `playground_config.json`
values initialize the standalone configuration (including 18 founders, 900 food,
0.18 viscosity and a 45-organism cap).

GitHub Actions validates pushes and pull requests; only pushes to main or manual
runs deploy to Pages. Dependencies are pinned and the lockfile is committed.

## Focused game repairs

- Respect an egg's actual reserve at hatching; remove the unfunded 100 J minimum.
- Count nonviable egg energy as nutrient energy **or** removed energy, once.
- Record decomposition energy lost when the nutrient cap prevents recycling,
  including discarded small remainders.
- At starvation, record only expenditure actually paid from the remaining reserve.
- Record tiny discarded food and egg remainders after feeding.
- Prevent negative storage room from producing negative absorption.
- Recompute reproduction readiness immediately after laying.
- Honor valid zero-valued environmental settings and the configured population cap.

No changes were made to motor torques, water drag, controller weights, energy
conversion constants, or inherited lifespan policies in this import.

## Executed local validation

`npm test`: **10 tests passed** against the gameplay `stepSimulation` module.
Coverage includes damaged and nonviable eggs, decomposition at the resource cap,
starvation accounting, all three mouth types, reproduction below the retired
capacity threshold, cooldown, positive-reserve age death, and a seeded ecosystem.

The seed-4242, 18-founder workload ran 60 simulated seconds at 60 ticks/s with
900 initial nutrients, 15 nutrients/s inflow and 0.18 water viscosity. Results:
**18 survivors, 0 deaths, 0 eggs, 0 hatches**; energy ledger discrepancy was
approximately **7 × 10⁻⁹ J**. This short workload verifies startup stability and
accounting; it does not establish long-term ecological sustainability.

`npm run build`: TypeScript checks and production compilation passed.
The browser test loads the built game below `/vidAI/`, checks startup assets,
starts the ecosystem, waits for simulated time to advance and pauses/resumes it.
Chromium downloads were unavailable in the local environment; browser execution
is therefore a required GitHub Actions check before deployment.

## Existing limitations / follow-up work

- The simulation and React UI remain mostly in the large `App.tsx` module.
- Save/load is not yet a complete deterministic continuation: settings,
  accumulator/counters and some histories are not all preserved, imports need
  deeper validation, and organism IDs still use `Math.random()`.
- The existing “Branch this Ecosystem” action clones the active state in memory;
  it does not yet retain independently selectable named experiments.
- The reference diagnostic still needs stronger isolation from the global PRNG
  and an audit of every displayed pass criterion.
- Functional sensory channel expansion and spatial indexing remain separate work.
- The brief startup run does not prove successful multigeneration evolution.

Keep these distinctions when reporting results. No hidden energy refill,
replacement population, or immunity was added.
